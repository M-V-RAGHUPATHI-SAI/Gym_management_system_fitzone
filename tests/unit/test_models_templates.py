from types import SimpleNamespace

# Example pattern: test simple pure-methods or methods that call DB helpers by monkeypatching those helpers.
#
# Replace these example imports with your real model modules if they exist.
# e.g. from app.models.member import Member

# --- Example 1: test a pure method on a model-like object ---
def test_member_full_name_style():
    # create a simple object that mimics your model's attributes
    member = SimpleNamespace(first_name="Alice", last_name="Smith")
    # Suppose your model has a function full_name(self) — test the formatting:
    # either create a tiny function that mirrors your model, or import the real method.
    # Example assertion if your model has method full_name:
    # assert Member(full_name logic).full_name() == "Alice Smith"

    # As a template, assert simple behavior:
    assert f"{member.first_name} {member.last_name}" == "Alice Smith"

# --- Example 2: test a method that calls a DB helper using monkeypatch ---
def test_model_method_calls_db(monkeypatch):
    # Suppose app.models.user.has_active_membership calls app.models.database.query(...)
    # We'll monkeypatch that DB helper to return known data.

    # import path example (adjust to your module)
    try:
        from app.models.user import User  # adjust if your model is named differently
    except Exception:
        User = None

    if User is None:
        pytest.skip("User model not present at app.models.user — adapt the import in this test file")

    # Create a sample user
    u = User()
    # ensure the user object has attributes used by the method
    setattr(u, "id", 123)

    # Monkeypatch the DB helper used inside the method. Find the import path inside your model
    # For demonstration:
    def fake_query_active(uid):
        return {"active": True}

    # Example: if User.has_active_membership internally calls `from app.models.database import get_membership_row`
    # you can monkeypatch that:
    monkeypatch.setattr("app.models.user.get_membership_row", lambda uid: {"active": True})

    # Now call the method and assert expected result
    if hasattr(u, "has_active_membership"):
        assert u.has_active_membership() in (True, False)  # adapt to expected signature
    else:
        pytest.skip("User.has_active_membership missing — adapt test to real method name")
